/*Benfordâ€™s Law, also called the First-Digit Law, refers to the
frequency distribution of digits in many (but not all) real-life sources of data. In this
distribution, 1 occurs as the leading digit about 30% of the time, while larger digits occur in
that position less frequently, for example 9 as the first digit occurs less than 5% of the time.*/
